Linkage disequilibrium network analysis (LDna)
-------------

LDna uses network analyses to find clusters of loci in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) from population genomic data sets (Kemppainen et al., unpublished).

Current beta version is 0.57.

###Installing

With **devtools** (accessible from CRAN) LDna can be installed by:
```r
devtools::install_github("petrikemppainen/LDna")
```
This downloads the source directly from **github** and builds the vignettes and thus requires LaTeX to be installed on your computer.

Alternatively, download the source file directly an install by:
```r
install.packages("/path_to/source_file", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```
